            <p>Elevate Your Web Design Craft: Unveiling the Aesthetics and Techniques</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Welcome to our web designing blog, a creative hub where we unravel the art and science of crafting
                captivating online experiences. Our passion lies in exploring the ever-evolving world of design, user
                interfaces, and digital aesthetics.</p>
            <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of
                websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI
                design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX
                design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different
                aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.The term "web design" is
                normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website
                including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web
                development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web
                accessibility guidelines.</p>
            <h3>The start of web and web design</h3>
            <p>In 1989, whilst working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which
                later became known as the World Wide Web. From 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only HTML
                pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode web browser.In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina,
                created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were
                Unix-based and naturally text-heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements
                such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.The W3C was created in October 1994 to
                "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution
                and ensure its interoperability."This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a proprietary
                browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole.
                The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript and other languages. In 1994
                Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the
                Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards
                process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text
                with tables on web pages. From 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for
                ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably
                Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to
                many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace</p>
            <h2>Evolution of web design</h2>
            <p>In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and
                HTML tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an
                obscure authoring technique and is today an important aspect of web design. The HTML markup for
                tables was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However, designers quickly realized the
                potential of using HTML tables for creating complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not
                possible. At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good markup
                structure, little attention was paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in
                their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web
                designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty
                table cells from collapsing. CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation
                and layout. This allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational and
                improved web accessibility, see tableless web design.</p>
            <h2>Tools and technologies</h2>
            <p>Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are
                involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind
                them remain the same. Web designers use both vector and raster graphics editors to create web-formatted
                imagery or design prototypes. A website can be created using WYSIWYG website builder software or content
                management system, or the individual web pages can be hand-coded in just the same manner as the first
                web pages were created. Other tools web designers might use include markup validators and other
                testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility
                guidelines.</p>
            <h3>User experience design and interactive design</h3>
            <p>User understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how the website
                works. This is part of the user experience design. User experience is related to layout, clear
                instructions, and labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may
                also depend on the interactive design of the site. If a user perceives the usefulness of the website,
                they are more likely to continue using it. Users who are skilled and well versed in website use may find
                a more distinctive, yet less intuitive or less user-friendly website interface useful nonetheless.
                However, users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages or usefulness of a less
                intuitive website interface. This drives the trend for a more universal user experience and ease of
                access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill. Much of the user
                experience design and interactive design are considered in the user interface design.</p>
