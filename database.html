            <p>Unveiling the Data Universe: Navigating the Depths of Database Management</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Welcome to our database blog, where we embark on a journey through the intricate realm of data management
                and storage. Our mission is to decode the complexities of databases, providing you with a compass to
                navigate through the data-driven landscape. From understanding the nuances of various database systems
                to mastering data modeling, optimization, and security, our curated articles and insights are designed
                to empower developers, administrators, and data enthusiasts alike.</p>
            <h2>Database</h2>
            <p> A database is an organized collection of data (also known as a data store) stored and accessed
                electronically through the use of a database management system. Small databases can be stored on a file
                system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The design of databases
                spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data
                representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed
                computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance.</p>
            <h3>Database Management System (DBMS)</h3>
            <p>A database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the
                database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core
                facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the
                associated applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term "database" is also used
                loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.
            </p>
            <h2>Terminology and overview</h2>
            <p>Formally, a "database" refers to a set of related data accessed through the use of a "database management
                system" (DBMS), which is an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one
                or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although
                restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that
                allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how
                that information is organized.

                Because of the close relationship between them, the term "database" is often used casually to refer to
                both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it.

                Outside the world of professional information technology, the term database is often used to refer to
                any collection of related data (such as a spreadsheet or a card index) as size and usage requirements
                typically necessitate use of a database management system.

                Existing DBMSs provide various functions that allow management of a database and its data which can be
                classified into four main functional groups:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Data definition</b> – Creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the
                    organization of the data.</li>
                <li><b>Update</b> – Insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data.</li>
                <li><b>Retrieval</b>– Providing information in a form directly usable or for further processing by other
                    applications. The retrieved data may be made available in a form basically the same as it is stored
                    in the database or in a new form obtained by altering or combining existing data from the database
                </li>
                <li><b>Administration</b>– Registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring
                    performance, maintaining data integrit</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Backup and restore</h2>
            <p>Sometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when
                the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data).
                To achieve this, a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database
                state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within
                dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When it is decided by a database
                administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired
                point in time when the database was in this state), these files are used to restore that state.</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The sizes, capabilities, and performance of databases and their respective DBMSs have grown in orders of
                magnitude. These performance increases were enabled by the technology progress in the areas of
                processors, computer memory, computer storage, and computer networks. The concept of a database was made
                possible by the emergence of direct access storage media such as magnetic disks, which became widely
                available in the mid-1960s; earlier systems relied on sequential storage of data on magnetic tape. The
                subsequent development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or
                structure: navigational, SQL/relational, and post-relational.

                The two main early navigational data models were the hierarchical model and the CODASYL model (network
                model). These were characterized by the use of pointers (often physical disk addresses) to follow
                relationships from one record to another.

                The relational model, first proposed in 1970 by Edgar F. Codd, departed from this tradition by insisting
                that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational
                model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only in the
                mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational
                systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all
                large-scale data processing applications, and as of 2018 they remain dominant: IBM Db2, Oracle, MySQL,
                and Microsoft SQL Server are the most searched DBMS. The dominant database language, standardized SQL
                for the relational model, has influenced database languages for other data models.[citation needed]

                Object databases were developed in the 1980s to overcome the inconvenience of object–relational
                impedance mismatch, which led to the coining of the term "post-relational" and also the development of
                hybrid object–relational databases.

                The next generation of post-relational databases in the late 2000s became known as NoSQL databases,
                introducing fast key–value stores and document-oriented databases. A competing "next generation" known
                as NewSQL databases attempted new implementations that retained the relational/SQL model while aiming to
                match the high performance of NoSQL compared to commercially available relational DBMSs.</p>
